Introduction
============

A collection portlet that use a custom view template to show search results.

User must manually put inside the "*Template Id*" field of the portlet the id of a Zope Page Template,
commonly available in *portal_skins*.

Seems crappy?
-------------

Yes, this is not very user friendly, but this product save us from developing a lot of
collection portlet clones!

Create you own template
-----------------------

Is simple, but start from the example you find in this product: check the
*base_collection_portlet_view.pt* file.
