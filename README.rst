Introduction
============

A collection portlet that use a custom view template to show search results.

User must manually put inside the "*Template Id*" field of the portlet the id of a Zope Page Template,
commonly available in *portal_skins*.

Please note: you can use a Zope 3 style @@view. 

Seems crappy?
-------------

Yes, this is not very user friendly, but this product save us from developing a lot of
collection portlet clones!

Create your own template
------------------------

It's simple, but we suggest you starting from the default template you will
find inside the source of this product: check the
`base_collection_portlet_view.pt`__ file.
